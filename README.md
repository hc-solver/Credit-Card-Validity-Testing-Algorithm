# Credit-Card-Validity-Testing-Algorithm
In credit card business, algorithm is implemented by the payment process business to issue new credit card # instead of generating random #. 
This is an example to test the validity of credit card number by implementing the following four rules
1. The first digit must be a 4.
2. The fourth digit must be one greater than the fifth digit; keep in mind that these
are separated by a dash since the format is ####-####-####.
3. The sum of all digits must be evenly divisible by 4.
4. If you treat the first two digits as a two-digit number, and the seventh and eighth
digits as a two-digit number, their sum must be 100.
